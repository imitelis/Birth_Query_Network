## BirthQuery Network


### TO DO (bare minimum):
  *  


### TO DO (if time smiles):

  *  Functional tests (httpx and pytest with mock DB)
  *  E2E tests (Cypress)


### For the BackEnd:

### Starting:
  *  Locate at the backend folder in the terminal and run `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment
  *  Then activate the venv using running `source venv/bin/activate`
  *  Install the dependencies neccessarily for the app to run, for this run `python3 -r install reqs.txt`
  *  Start the application by finally running `python3 main.py`
  *  You can check the API by visiting `localhost/docs#` in your browser and read about our endpoints available
  *  Keep in mind, you still need to connect the database in order to make any request to the API

### Connecting DB
  *  TO do

### Testing:
  *  Locate at the backend folder (`/birthquery-backend` NOT the `/birthquery-backend/tests` folder)
  *  Be sure that the venv is activated (run `source venv/bin/activate`) for that
  *  Then run `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)`, this will automatically retrieve your folder location at set it to PYTHONPATH,
  which is required to run the tests correctly
  *  Then just run `pytest tests/` and see the tests results in the terminal
  
### Trying on your own:
  *  Admin user: { "username": "administrator", "password:" "verystrongpassword" }
  *  Do not forget to add the access token and admin_secret for privileges: "00f2b58bc6f6890b2470b7e1b5c8a7d4a5a3e47608a9910bc17888bcd2989b71dcacf889e20ca7ab75fa415a0ad8f53d2d730b99411cad63737b72c1f8cfb954"
  *  Average joe: { "username": "goodcitizen", "password": "veryoriginalpassword" }
