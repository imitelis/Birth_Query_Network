# Birth Query Network: Userguide

Dear user, thank you so much for trusting our Google cloud data and for selecting us!

After finishing this small guide, you are going to be capable to run the product in your machine and use it locally (for using it deployed in the cloud, you would have to contact us for details and pricing :-) )


## Make the app run locally:
  *  well...


## Once that docker-composer is successfully running:
  *  Well that's it! From here you should go to `localhost:9000/` in your preferred browser and see the app running
  *  In the home page, you can go to the navbar at top and go to `sign up` in order to create your new account
  *  And after a successfully sign up, you can go to login to log with your new account
  *  From here you are going to be capable to new options in the navbar, particularly the `Queries`, click there
  *  In this page, you can see the full list of all queries created by other users and you can search on them by name on the searching field
  *  You can also select a random query and by pressing on its `Run Query` button it will automatically redirect you to the birth query menu
  *  Here you can manipulate the query and make one on your own, feel free to customize it as much as you want
  *  If you are happy with the result, you can use `Save Query` to save your query
  *  So now other users can go and see your query...
  *  For admin privileges, consider login in as `administrator` with `verystrongpassword` as password :-)
